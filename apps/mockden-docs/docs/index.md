# Mockden Documentation

## Overview

Mockden provides a powerful and flexible way to define, validate, and enforce data schemas for your applications. It offers comprehensive schema definition capabilities with advanced validation rules and error handling.

## What Does Mockden Do?

Mockden enables you to:

- **Define Complex Data Schemas**: Create structured data definitions with multiple field types and validation rules
- **Validate Data Against Schemas**: Ensure your data conforms to predefined structures and constraints
- **Type-Safe Operations**: Leverage TypeScript for compile-time type checking and runtime validation
- **Advanced Validation Rules**: Apply field-specific validation constraints like min/max values, length limits, and pattern matching
- **Primary Key Management**: Enforce unique identifiers with proper type constraints
- **Nested Object Support**: Create hierarchical data structures with nested fields
- **Error Handling**: Get detailed, field-specific error messages for validation failures
